# function:   	countscds()
# purpose:		Generate and count all possible gamestates and moves for SCDS games with l through
#               r elements
#               Only returns reasonable values for n>3 - takes several minutes for values of n>10
# parameters:	l:Starting number of elements inclusive - must be <=r  (natural number),
#               r:Ending number of elements inclusive - must be >=l (natural number),
#               pretty:Default TRUE - if false, returns no text in output
#               timed:Default TRUE - Count execution time
#               countgamestates:Default TRUE - returns number of gamestates for each set of elements
#               Example:countcdr(3,5,pretty=F) returns a named list with the total number of 
#                       states and moves possible for sets of 1 to 3,4,5 along with exectution time.
