# CDS
CDS and CDR game code repo

Created by Joshua Watson and Alyssa Seideman. 


To run, source both 'generating scripts.r' and 'tree functions.r'. All functions and libraries required are accounted for in those two scripts. This is still a work in progress, so check the repo at https://github.com/zediiiii/CDR-Games for updates.
